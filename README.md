## Disclaimer

AskPDF is currently in beta, and while we have taken great care in its development, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- AskPDF is designed to handle simple questions, but if the PDF file is too long, it will limit processing to the first 512 tokens, which may impact the accuracy of the answers.
- As a beta version, AskPDF is a work in progress, and we appreciate user feedback to improve its features and performance.
- While we strive to deliver the best possible results, there may be instances where AskPDF does not produce the right answer due to the complexity of the query or limitations in processing longer PDF files.

Please note that while using AskPDF, it's advisable to use concise questions and consider the length of the PDF file for optimal results.

Thank you for trying out AskPDF!
